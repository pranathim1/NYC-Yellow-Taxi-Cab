# NYC-Yellow-Taxi-Cab
This project was done as a part of python programming class in grad school. 
It is focused on looking at various metrics such as the time taken to reach NYC's airports, popular pickup and dropoff location etc. All the above metrics are visualized on NYC's map using python's plotly and folium packages. Impact of weather on number of taxi trips of a zip on a particular day is observed by performing statistical tests and regression analysis
